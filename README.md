## Project Context

The Municipality of San Mateo, Rizal, has long provided essential services such as healthcare, education, and public safety to its citizens. However, despite offering these crucial services, the municipality still relies on traditional processes, including outdated queuing methods. These methods have led to inefficiencies and long waiting times, which can negatively impact the experience of citizens who need to access public services and obtain important documents.

The proponents of the project recognize the need for modernization and seek to address the challenges faced by the municipality. To enhance the delivery of services, we propose the implementation of an **Integrated Online Management System (OSSM)**. This system will digitize and streamline the existing processes, providing an efficient, user-friendly platform for citizens to request services, acquire documents, and engage with the municipal government. 

The OSSM will reduce the dependency on manual, in-person interactions, improve service delivery speed, and provide greater accessibility for citizens. By modernizing the way municipal services are provided, the system will contribute to enhancing the overall public experience, ensuring that services are delivered faster, more securely, and with higher transparency.
